### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Project Objectives
Define a comprehensive, user-friendly IMS that streamlines inventory tracking, improves stock accuracy, and enables real-time visibility across multiple warehouses. The system aims to support timely restocking, automated alerts, and efficient demand order management.

#### 1.2 Project Scope
- **Included:** Real-time stock tracking, restock alerts, multi-warehouse inventory coordination, demand order management, and reporting tools.
- **Excluded:** Logistics and delivery management, customer relationship management.

#### 1.3 Project Overview
This project will develop an IMS for Acme Inc., designed to meet warehouse needs and provide inventory insights across multiple locations. Key phases include development (backend with Flask, frontend with Vue.js and Bootstrap), testing (using pytest), and deployment (on AWS EC2 and S3). Expected outcomes include a robust, scalable system with features like multi-warehouse coordination and automated restocking alerts.
